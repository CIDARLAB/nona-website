              Nona Research Foundation, Inc. (“NRF”) was created to broaden participation, increase access, and advance innovation in the design, distribution, documentation, maintenance, and use of open-source software and tools in the fields of synthetic biology and bio-design automation.  Research using NRF’s software and other tools will lead to advances and improvement in health and healthcare, energy production and storage, materials manufacture, protection of the environment, and human welfare.  Producing life-saving pharmaceuticals, repairing defective genes, destroying cancer cells, generating biofuels, cleaning up the environment, and assisting climate change through carbon capture, are examples of the specific applications anticipated in synthetic biology and related scientific fields enabled by NRF advances.

NRF’s activities will be developed to accomplish:  
<ul>
   <li>
Research and development of the software, tools and associated documentation in systems that will enable scientists to design and construct a broad range of biological tools, techniques, and scientific understanding
</li><li>
Maintenance and improvement of such software, tools and associated documentation
</li>
<li>
Availability and accessability of such software, tools and associated documentation, so that they are more widely and freely available to the public.
</li></ul>
</p>
<p>
NRF intends to set up an online hub, organize related national events and programs, and hold local meetings where software developers, researchers, students, and interested third parties come together to share needs and experiences.  Through these activities, NRF will serve as a clearinghouse for knowledge and emerging research helping to accelerate the creation of powerful new open source tools for for synthetic biology and bio-design automation.  The network aims to bring together academic and research groups adept at designing software and carrying out research-based activities, with others who can ensure broad distribution to make these advances widely available and useful to participants around the country.
